I didn’t have much time in the morning because I needed to fix the plumbing in the bathroom, but then at noon I already had an appointment to get my eyes tested. Not really sure, what type of frames I want to get for my new glasses. I kind of like the square ones, but my sister told me to get the large round ones. Anyway, I got my bread on the way back home, was stopping by at the supermarket that’s right on the way. Was really hungry by that time, so I had two slices with some spread I picked up the other week at the farmer’s market. Of course, it’s important to stay hydrated as well, so I had a glass of water. And because I was still thirsty, I had another one. You know, I like drinking tap water, the tap water we have here is really good. Anyway, I was scrolling through the Playstore as I was sitting and drinking and that’s how I found the app.\",positive\n","My pohne is getting super hot bruned rihgt through my pocket,negative\n","My cat is a meteorology genius compared to this app.,negative\n","Asked if I needed to take an umbrella with me today to work.
